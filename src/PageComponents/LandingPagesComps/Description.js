      <p>Here at FIFO our goal is to make sure that animals dont have to wait to be adopted.
        Our name stands for first in first out and thats our model for adoption.
        You can choose from a dog or cat, and the first pet of that type will be available to adopt.
        If you decide that particular pet isnt what your looking for we require you to start the process
        over and head to the back of the line.We hope to find all of our animals happy loving homes here at FIFO.
